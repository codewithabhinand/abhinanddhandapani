### Abhinand Dhandapani

Hi ðŸ‘‹  Reader, 

Here I have made a short story of my life, hope you like it!.  (or skip to [[#**Summary** (Summarised by Claude 3 Haiku)|Short Summary]])

=="The Rise of Abhinand: A Tale of Discovery"==


In **October 2001**, a miracle occurred that significantly impacted the history of the world. Around half-past five in the evening, _a child was born_. His parents always believed he would make the world a better place. Though his childhood was quite ordinary and he was an average student, he had a weak heart and was not particularly strong.

During secondary school, he began to understand the world around him, forming new relationships and learning how people connect. Time passed quickly, and soon he was in university. There, he became more active with his friends, and his hall mates became like family. It was a challenging time for him, being away from his family, but it had a significant impact on his life.

In his first year of university, he made many new friends and became well-known in his class. Despite being an average student, he was one of his teachers' favourite students because of his beliefs. However, his university life was disrupted by the **COVID-19 pandemic** and subsequent lockdowns. This did not deter our hero. He set up his computer and became active day and night, exploring various ways to procrastinate. This marked the beginning of his **programming journey**. To avoid attending online classes, he created an **automatic class attender**, allowing him to sleep during class hours. Though not productive, he found classes boring and preferred to do something more productive, like sleeping.

He used Python for his projects. His parents ran a clothing business, which presented another challenge. They often asked him to manage the shop and handle sales. However, he preferred to stay home, avoiding the rush at the shop. He sought a way to **monitor shop sales remotely** and, inspired by his programming skills, took on the challenge of creating a solution.

For three months, he struggled to **crack the database** and use Python to extract and manage the data. During this time, he also developed various **software tools for automating tasks**. Finally, in his fourth month and final year of university, he succeeded. He set up a system to get notifications about shop sales through **Telegram**, a trending app at the time. This allowed him to avoid trouble with his parents.

His **passion for data** continued to grow, eventually leading him to **travel abroad** to further his career. Everything in his life seemed magical and interesting, and his journey of exploring love and passion for data continued.
